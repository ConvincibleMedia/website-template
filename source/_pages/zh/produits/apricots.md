An apricot is a fruit, or the **tree** that bears the fruit, of several *species* in the genus Prunus ([stone fruits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot)).

### Did you know?

Usually, an apricot tree is from the species P. armeniaca, but the species:

* P. brigantina
* P. mandshurica
* P. mume
* P. sibirica

are closely related, have similar fruit, and are also called apricots.

> The scientific name armeniaca was first used by Gaspard Bauhin in his Pinax Theatri Botanici (1623), referring to the species as Mala armeniaca \"Armenian apple\".

Linnaeus took up Bauhin\'s epithet in the first edition of his Species Plantarum in 1753, Prunus armeniaca.

Apricot derives from praecocia (praecoquus) as \"cooked or ripened beforehand\" \[in this case meaning early ripening\], and from Greek &pi;&rho;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;ÏŒ&kappa;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (praik&oacute;kion) as \"apricot\".

The English name first appeared in the 16th century as abrecock from the Middle French aubercot or later abricot, from Catalan a(l)bercoc.
